This Telegram bot will serve as your personal work time assistant, tracking the time you spend at work, including possible breaks, and tell you at which time you're supposed to clock out. It will also track the under- and over-time you spend at work, making it easier for you to manage your work week and keep track of how much time you spend each day.
